**Docker Networking**

Docker containers can be connected together or to non-Docker workloads

They dont need to be aware that they are deployed in docker

we can use docker to manage them in a platform-agnostic way

**Challenges**

- Portability
- Service discovery
- Load Balancing
- Security
- Performance
- Scalability

Docker engine is able to perform the following:

- Manipulates iptables rules on Linux
- Manipulates routing rules on Windows servers
- Forms and encapsulates packets and handles encryption

This facilitates connecting containers across hosts and exposing applications running in containers as web services

Docker Default Bridge Network

- Bridge is the default and is an isolated network used when apps run in standalone containers that need to communicate

- Default is present in all Docker hosts

- If not specified to a different network, automatically connected to the default bridge network

- Containers connected to the default bridge can comms each other by IP address

User the Docker network create --driver bridge isolated_network command to create a bridge network

After you create the network, launch containers using docker run --network=<Network> option

Containers launched into the isolated_network must be on the same host

We can expose and publish container ports on containers in this network to make applications available to an outside network

Bridge is the default

## Best Practices while developing microservices

- Have seperate data store for microservice

  - Same data stores (Monolithic database) - defeats microservices purpose

  - Any downtime or change impacts all microservices that uses the db

  - so exclusive db for our microservice

  - any other microservices that need access to the data would access it through the APIs that the microservice with write access has given out

    Sample :

    For a restaurant services,

    Order service API -> Order microservice -> Order table

    Customer service API -> Customer microservice -> Customer table

- Have seperate build for microservices and automate deployment process

  - helps save time for coordinating multiple teams for regular maintenance or upgradation

  - Does not impact unfair amount of resource for a single service just because they are sharing resources

  - Isolates faults from other components helping fault tolerance and avoiding full blown outage

  - DevOps model is to enhance efficiency by enabling automation

  - can be automated with automation tools like Jenkins that automate DevOps workflows by facilitating CI/CD

- Fail fast by using a circuit breaker to achieve fault tolerance

  - if a microservice is dependent on another system to provide response, it takes forever and overall response is impacted

  - to avoid, best practice is to use a circuit breaker to timeout the external call and return a default response or error

  - it isolates the failing services without causing cascading failures

  - can use Popular products like Hystrix (developed by Netflix)

  - This is better than using HTTP CONNECT_TIMEOUT and READ_TIMEOUT settings since it doesnt show additional threads beyond what is config'd

  Sample:

  Normal period of times:

  Service Consumer <->Circuit Breaker(Closed)<->Microservice

  When fault occurs:

  Service Consumer <->Circuit Breaker(Open)->Microservice‚ùé

- Proxy your microservice requests through an API gateway

  - Instead of every microservice performing the functions of API (auth, request/response etc.,) having API gateway doing will add a lot of value

  - Clients will call microservices through API gateway instead of directly calling your service

  - Avoids additional calls from microservice and the internal URLs for the service would be hidden which gives you the flexibility to redirect the traffic to the newer version of the service from the API Gateway

  - When a third party is accessing your service, throttle incoming traffic and reject unauthorized requests from the API gateway

  - Can have seperate API gateway that accepts traffic from external networks

  Sample:

  Using a single custom API gateway service

  Client Mobile/SPA Web/Traditional Web app <--> API Gateway <--> Microservices 1/2/3/4

- Domain Driven Design

  - The first challenge, to develop microservices is to split a large, complex app into small, autonomous, independently deployable modules.

  - if not splitted in a right way, which gives tightly coupled causing to have the cons of the monolith and the complexities of the microservices.

  - Solution: Domain Driven Design

  - Works on Three Core Concepts:

    1. Software dev team should work in close co-operation with the _domain experts_

    2. The devs and domain should first make the strategic design: Finding the Bounded context and related Core Domain and Ubiquitous Language, Subdomain, Context Maps

    3. The devs should then make the tactical design to decompose the core domain into very small building blocks: Entity, value object, aggregate, aggregate root.

    (Brief: Software dev close co-operated with domain experts, make strategic design, make tatical design)

  - If a large system is divided into core domain & sub-domains, they are then mapped to one or more microservices, which gives us the ideal loosely coupled microservices.

  Sample:
  In a Delivery scenario,

  Delivery Context : Product<-Order->Customer

  Finances Context : Bank acc<-Customer->Financial address

- Use a centralized logging and monitoring system

  - Centralized logging system ensures that all microservices ship their log in a standardized format but save logs carefully for each of them

  - Its helps in faster error handling and root cause analysis

  - Not only helps monitor resource availability but also maintains security by identifying compromised resources early

  Sample:

  Multiple MS ->seperate logs -> logstash -> elastic search -> Kibana

- Use OAuth for user identity and access control

  - Some third-party apps need to access data from different users or integrate data from multiple users

  - With OAuth, when third-party app accesses the service, the app prompts the user to authorize to use the corresponding access authority and generates a token based on the user permissions for access

  - For user authentication of the microservice itself, OAuth may also be used to delegate user authentication of the microservice to a third party auth service provider

  - purpose is to integrate and utilize the OAuth authentication service provided by a well-known auth provider which simplifies the registeration operations(here the microservice acts a client to the OAuth Architecture)

  Sample:

  User logins with credentials -> API gateway-> Auth Server(AS) gives back a token to the user(JWT token)

  User asks for a resource X with JWT token -> API Gateway ->Microservice that is responsible for resource X will ask Auth server whether User can access resource X based on the JWT token -> Based on the response Resource X will either be provided or not

Non- Functional Characteristics of microservices

- Scalability

  App A supports N number of users with current infrastructure

  Can v increase the infrastructure by a factor of 10 to support 10 times the N?

  Types of Scalability:

  - Vertical Scalability: All about increasing the hardware and processing and capacity available to a system

  Vertical scaling for a microservice system would be achieved by increasing the CPU processing power or the amount of main memory on the physical server

  Limit: It is very expensive to purchase powerful hardware and it can only help you to a certain extent

  - Horizontal Scalability: Increasing the number of instances of the microservice or the naming servers or the API gateways

- Security

  Protect the system from unintended use, denial-of-service attacks,unauthorized access

  Restrict the authorized users to access only the modules that they are allowed to

  Applying Security Principles:

  1. Assign least Privileges
  2. Have Complete Mediation
  3. Have Defence in Depth
  4. Trust Nothing
  5. Have economy of Mechanism
  6. Ensure Openness of Design

  Best Practices:

  1. Think about security from Day 1
  2. Be Aware of OWASP
  3. Use Analysis Tools
  4. Friendly Hacking
  5. Avoid Outdated Standards and Frameworks
  6. Safeguard your infrastructure

- Performance

  A measure of how much time a system takes to respond to a user request

  Recommended Steps to follow to improve performance:

  1. Improve the code
  2. Fine-Tune your DB
  3. Cache your data
  4. Build Redundancy
  5. Improve System Capacity
  6. Ensure Modular Design
